            <p>
                Who would've thought </br>
                A certain night in a certain call </br>
                A certain person would make me fall in love? </br>
                Who would've thought </br>
                Broken english and weird thoughts </br>
                A clumsy ass would make me fall in love? </br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Came into my life suddenly </br>
                Made it sooo lovely </br>
                And youu dont even know </br>
                Your laugh is all I ever need </br>
                You voice is like a therapy </br>
                The more I know you the more I fall in love, </br>
            </p>
